For this project, I was asked to handle the survey for one of the Indonesia Art Community in China regarding their management community in 2019/2020. The purpose is to understand how they member feel about the community, what they thought good or bad for the community, and advice/critique in the community, and also who is the next leader that they want. 

I make the survey with "mikeCRM" because it can be used both in China and Indonesia so the members in China can also fill the survey same as member in Indonesia. After that, I clean and arrange the data result in google sheet, in order to prepare for data visualization. Finally, to provide the result back to the community that will analyze, I use Google Data Studio for the Dashboard
